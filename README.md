## Homework #5: Work Day Schedule 

### Task

For this assignment, we need to make a simple work day schedule application. This would work by making a HTML and CSS that is operated by jQuery. In order for this application to work, we would also need to use Moment.js so we can work with the current time and date. 


### Installation
  For this assignment you will need:
  - A new repository for the assignment and clone to repository `git@github.com:alimariam12/Work-Calender.git` to the terminal.
  - Visual Studio Code: after downloading the homework to the appropriate folder, use command `code .` to get to VSC. 
  
### Acceptance Criteria
  My assignment needs to meet the following criterias:
  - Have the current day displayed on the top of the page.
  - Have the usual business hours displayed on the side of the page within the time blocks.
  - Have different time blocks to represent past, present, and future.
  - Have Moment.js working so it can show accurate current time and day.
  - Have save button work to save the inforamtion within that time block.
  - Have that information save onto the local storage.
  - Have the information be saved even when you refresh the page.
